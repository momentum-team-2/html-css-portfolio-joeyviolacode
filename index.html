                <h2>Joey O'Donnell</h2>
                <article>Thanks for stopping by.  I'm excited to start my coding journey here at Momentum.  I've always been interested in logic and math, and I'm always looking for new things to challenge my brain.  As a musician, I've long practiced the discipline and problem solving skills it takes to prepare music to professional standards.  As an avid puzzler, I've long honed my skills at working through problems, often ones whose exact nature is unknown at the outset.  I try to expand myself every day, and I look forward to seeing all the ways code allows me to do that.</article>
